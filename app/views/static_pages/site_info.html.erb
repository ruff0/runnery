				Runnery is a live, restaurant to driver, food delivery feed.

			</p>

			<p align="justify">

				Drivers choose deliveries by time, pickup/dropoff locations, delivery surcharge, and customer payment type, from a pool of local restaurants' deliveries. Drivers are paid cash by a combination of the restaurant, and/or delivery recipient.

			</p>

			<p align="justify">

				The driver is entitled to a variable surcharge, at $3 standard. Surcharge reflects order size/cost, delivery distance, cost of gas, etc.

			</p>

	        <p align="justify">

	        	 Restaurants' first 100 deliveries are free, then a $125 payment is required per 500 deliveries ($0.25/del.). The cost of using Runnery can be balanced by the difference in surcharge paid to drivers and surcharge charged to customers.

	        </p>

			<p align="justify">

				Drivers are expected to pay for cash orders up-front, minus surcharge, and be reembersed/tipped on delivery.

			</p>

			<p align="justify">

				 Debited orders are paid in-full and surcharge is paid by the restaurant on pickup. Tip is either paid by the restuarant on pickup, or by the customer on delivery.
			</p>
			
			<p align="justify">

				For credited tips, a receipt must be redeemed by the restaurant and tips paid after. Returning to the restaurant is not required for receipts with no tip. Surcharge is always paid on pickup.
